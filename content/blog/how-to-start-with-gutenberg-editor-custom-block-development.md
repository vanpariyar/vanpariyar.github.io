## How to start with Gutenberg Editor custom block development.

Start learning Gutenberg very easily. See step by step Guide.

How to start with Gutenberg editor development. What should I learn?

### For Reference:

So, My simple first answer is you should start the development using the new block by going [WordPress Block developer handbook.](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/)

Believe me or not this is the best resource in the world after you know some basics of Javascript syntax.

### Type of JS to develop Gutenberg Block

 1. Simple Javascript.

 2. ES next standards.

My personal choice is [create guten block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block). this is an opensource NPM package for development Gutenberg block.

This package has all setup of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and one of the best parts is the setup process goes easy.

Go with ES next standards.

## Relationship with React and Gutenberg Editor

Gutenberg is developed on the top of [React](https://reactjs.org/).

### Can I use Hooks like react

yes, you can use it. You can pull out from wp.element.

 1. useState()

 2. useRef()

 3. etc..

If you don't know React hooks Go here: [https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
