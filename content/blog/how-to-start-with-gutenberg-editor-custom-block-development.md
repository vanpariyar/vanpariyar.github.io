## How to Start with Gutenberg Editor Custom Block Development

Developing custom blocks for the Gutenberg editor can be simple and rewarding. This guide will walk you through the essentials and provide key resources to get started with WordPress block development.

### Where to Begin?

The best place to start is by diving into the [WordPress Block Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/). It covers everything from creating simple blocks to advanced customizations, and is the go-to resource once you’ve got the basics of JavaScript under your belt.

### JavaScript Options for Gutenberg Block Development

When it comes to developing Gutenberg blocks, you have two primary options:

1. **Vanilla JavaScript**
2. **Modern ESNext (ES6+) standards**

While both can work, I recommend using **ESNext standards** to leverage the latest JavaScript features and take advantage of modern workflows.

A great tool to get you started with Gutenberg block development is [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block), an open-source NPM package. This package comes pre-configured with **Webpack** and **ESLint**, making setup a breeze. It’s perfect for developers looking for a hassle-free environment to start building custom blocks.

### React and Gutenberg: The Relationship

Gutenberg is built on top of **React**, so if you have experience with React, you’re already a step ahead. Knowing React’s component-based architecture will make Gutenberg block development much easier.

#### Can You Use React Hooks in Gutenberg?

Yes! Since Gutenberg uses React under the hood, you can utilize hooks such as:

1. **useState()**
2. **useRef()**

Hooks allow you to manage state and references in your blocks just like you would in a React application. You can import them from `wp.element`.

If you’re new to hooks, check out the official [React Hooks Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to get started.

### My Development Experience

#### Simple JavaScript Blocks

I’ve built a few simple Gutenberg blocks using vanilla JavaScript. You can check out a demo on my GitHub repository here:

#### ESNext and Modern Development

For more complex projects, I prefer using **ESNext**. One of the plugins I developed using this approach is available on GitHub:  
[**vanpariyar/gutenberg-instagram-post-grid**](https://github.com/vanpariyar/gutenberg-instagram-post-grid)

You can also check out this plugin on WordPress’s plugin repository:  
[**Social Gallery Block**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-gallery-block)

### Additional Demos

I’ve also created other demos showcasing different features of Gutenberg block development. One such demo involves fetching random quotes and saving them in the WordPress database:

### Final Thoughts

If you’re just starting out with Gutenberg block development, it may feel overwhelming at first. But with tools like **Create Guten Block** and resources like the **WordPress Developer Handbook**, you’ll be able to develop custom blocks quickly and efficiently. Keep experimenting and don’t hesitate to dive into the React ecosystem—it’ll pay off in the long run.
