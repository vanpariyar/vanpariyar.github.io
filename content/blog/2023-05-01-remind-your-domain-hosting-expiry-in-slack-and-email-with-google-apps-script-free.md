> This tutorial describes how to leverage google apps script and Google sheets to remind you of your due subscription on Time for free of cost.

## Introduction

Yes it is possible üôÇ with very small google apps script programs. You can use and customise this program to use in and combine with any services.

This article will guide you how we track our domain and server due dates. It will help to save costs while starting a small business with a small portfolio of clients.

## Start from here

### Appscript Part

By copying this sheet you will also get the code for the setup, I will explain later in the blog. 


You will have a basic sheet setup. Fill the details for the website and renew the date accordingly. 

## How to Test Properly
First Test the main function by running in the editor. It will show unverified because you have not verified this app on google cloud, No problem you will need to click on Advance. Then click the unsafe option. No Problem you can verify your script later.  

This will not remind automatically, We need to set up a trigger for the function.
