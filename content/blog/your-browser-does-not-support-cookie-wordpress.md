Your browser does not support cookie wordpress
----------------------------------------------

I am recently working with the wordpress staging setup and i realise that i can not Login in to wordpress site.

Lots of solutions were searched online and asked by many people but last i found this solution.

Literally it took me 1 to 2 hours just to migrate Local Site to Beta site.

### Steps:

Here Are the steps that I have tried.Hope it solves your issue.

1.  Just migrate the database first before migrating site. You can use plugins Like [Wp Migrate DB](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db/).

2.  Upload your files to staging or Beta server.

3.  Then upload your database.

This is the simple step to avoid the Cookie issue. Because wordpress sometimes confuses cookies.

Cookies are saved in Wordpress transient so might be an issue.
