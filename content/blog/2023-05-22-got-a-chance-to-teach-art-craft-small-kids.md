## How we get chance to teach art and craft?
My wife and Me used to visit Swaminarayan Gurukul Nikol. We get to know that they are having a residential summer camp for 5 days. We approach them that we want to volunteer there.

Some days ago i posted that my wife started Art and Craft classes so go there for Help.

### What kids learned in summer camp ?
There were many activities in the summer camp
- Habit to get up early morning.
- They do prayer after morning routine.
- They also got learning from many mentors.

## Preparation

We started thinking that what we can teach to kids. So they can easily understand. We thought many ideas but we also have to manage with small budget. So we decided to Teach how to make paper camera ðŸ“¸ and Goggles ðŸ¥½.

### Got more hands working with us
We did asked about count of students for the summer camp

it went well ðŸ˜€ by the way, We teach craft first to organizing Team. they are able to grasp easily.

Students started coming and fill the assembly hall, there are 80 students. It went well.

Mostly students complete craft assignments. they also like to make camara from the paper.
