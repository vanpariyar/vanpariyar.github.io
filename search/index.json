[{"content":"Hello üëã\nIn this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how to self-host a WordPress Playground on GitHub Pages. This is a fun and educational project that not only saves bandwidth for WordPress servers but also allows you to showcase your product on a custom domain.\nWhy Self-Host WordPress Playground? WordPress Playground primarily uses static files and runs directly in the user\u0026rsquo;s browser. By self-hosting it on GitHub Pages, you can save bandwidth on WordPress servers and provide a unique experience by using your custom domain. This is especially useful if you want to demo your product or create a personalized WordPress Playground instance.\nHow to Self-Host WordPress Playground To get started, follow these steps:\n1. Fork the WordPress Playground Repository First, fork the WordPress Playground repository from GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.\n2. Create a GitHub Actions Workflow Next, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to set up a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the playground to GitHub Pages. Create a new workflow file, for example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 name: Deploy to GitHub Pages on: workflow_dispatch: concurrency: group: website-deployment jobs: build_and_deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest environment: name: playground-wordpress-net-wp-cloud steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: true - uses: ./.github/actions/prepare-playground - run: npm run build - name: Deploy üöÄ uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4 with: folder: dist/packages/playground/wasm-wordpress-net # The folder the action should deploy. 3. Run the Workflow Manually After setting up the workflow, trigger it manually. This will build the project and deploy it to GitHub Pages.\nAdding a Custom Domain to GitHub Pages To use a custom domain for your WordPress Playground, follow these steps:\nGo to the settings of your GitHub Pages repository.\nUnder \u0026ldquo;Pages,\u0026rdquo; set up your custom domain.\nUpdate your domain\u0026rsquo;s DNS settings:\nCNAME Record: Name: playground Value: your-github-username.github.io A Record: Name: @ (or your domain name, e.g., domain.com) Value: The IP address of GitHub Pages (check the latest IP addresses in GitHub documentation). Example After completing these steps, you can have your own self-hosted playground, such as playground.vanpariyar.in.\nThanks For Reading üôè\nThis articles is rewritten from generative AI, But carefully reviewed by Me personally.

This guide will walk you through the essentials and provide key resources to get started with WordPress block development.\nWhere to Begin? The best place to start is by diving into the WordPress Block Developer Handbook. It covers everything from creating simple blocks to advanced customizations, and is the go-to resource once you‚Äôve got the basics of JavaScript under your belt.\nJavaScript Options for Gutenberg Block Development When it comes to developing Gutenberg blocks, you have two primary options:\nVanilla JavaScript Modern ESNext (ES6+) standards While both can work, I recommend using ESNext standards to leverage the latest JavaScript features and take advantage of modern workflows.\nA great tool to get you started with Gutenberg block development is Create Guten Block, an open-source NPM package. This package comes pre-configured with Webpack and ESLint, making setup a breeze. It‚Äôs perfect for developers looking for a hassle-free environment to start building custom blocks.\nReact and Gutenberg: The Relationship Gutenberg is built on top of React, so if you have experience with React, you‚Äôre already a step ahead. Knowing React‚Äôs component-based architecture will make Gutenberg block development much easier.\nCan You Use React Hooks in Gutenberg? Yes! Since Gutenberg uses React under the hood, you can utilize hooks such as:\nuseState() useRef() Hooks allow you to manage state and references in your blocks just like you would in a React application. You can import them from wp.element.\nIf you‚Äôre new to hooks, check out the official React Hooks Documentation to get started.\nMy Development Experience Simple JavaScript Blocks I‚Äôve built a few simple Gutenberg blocks using vanilla JavaScript. You can check out a demo on my GitHub repository here:\nhttps://github.com/vanpariyar/gutenberg-blocks-plugin\nESNext and Modern Development For more complex projects, I prefer using ESNext. One of the plugins I developed using this approach is available on GitHub:\nvanpariyar/gutenberg-instagram-post-grid\nYou can also check out this plugin on WordPress‚Äôs plugin repository:\nSocial Gallery Block\nAdditional Demos I‚Äôve also created other demos showcasing different features of Gutenberg block development. One such demo involves fetching random quotes and saving them in the WordPress database:\nvanpariyar/gutenberg-demo-esnext\nFinal Thoughts If you‚Äôre just starting out with Gutenberg block development, it may feel overwhelming at first. But with tools like Create Guten Block and resources like the WordPress Developer Handbook, you‚Äôll be able to develop custom blocks quickly and efficiently. Keep experimenting and don‚Äôt hesitate to dive into the React ecosystem‚Äîit‚Äôll pay off in the long run.\nIf it is helpful¬†and saves your valuable Time ‚è± please show your support üëá.

This guide covers how to authenticate and retrieve user details using the Instagram Graph API.\nGet-Instagram-Details (Updated) Instagram has deprecated its public API, and now you need an Instagram Access Token to fetch user data. To retrieve details like username, profile picture, bio, and follower count, you must authenticate your app and get the appropriate permissions using the Instagram Graph API.\nSteps to Get Instagram Details Set up your Instagram Developer account:\nGo to the Instagram for Developers page. Create an app and get the App ID and App Secret. Get User Access Token:\nAfter setting up the app, use OAuth to authenticate users and retrieve the access token. You\u0026rsquo;ll need the user_profile and user_media permissions to access user details. You can refer to Facebook\u0026rsquo;s OAuth documentation for details on the authentication flow. Make API requests:\nOnce authenticated, you can use the following endpoint to get the user\u0026rsquo;s data: https://graph.instagram.com/me?fields=id,username,media_count,account_type\u0026amp;access_token={access-token}\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of how you can use fetch to get the data:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 $(\u0026#39;.instagram-get\u0026#39;).on( \u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function(event) { let accessToken = \u0026#39;YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\u0026#39;; // Replace with a valid access token fetch(`https://graph.instagram.com/me?fields=id,username,media_count,account_type\u0026amp;access_token=${accessToken}`) .then(response =\u0026gt; response.json()) .then(data =\u0026gt; { console.log(data); $(\u0026#34;.username\u0026#34;).html(data.username); $(\u0026#34;.media-count\u0026#34;).html(data.media_count); $(\u0026#34;.account-type\u0026#34;).html(data.account_type); $(\u0026#39;.insta-details\u0026#39;).show(\u0026#39;slow\u0026#39;); }) .catch(error =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#39;Error fetching Instagram details:\u0026#39;, error)); }); Important Notes: The new Instagram API only supports user data that you have permission to access (your account or authenticated users).\nYou can also fetch media-related data such as recent posts using the media endpoints:\nhttps://graph.instagram.com/me/media?fields=id,caption,media_url\u0026amp;access_token={access-token}\nDemo URL (Deprecated) The demo that previously used the public GraphQL API no longer works, as Instagram now requires OAuth authentication and access tokens. You can check the Instagram API documentation for more details on building your app.\nIf you are still reading this, \u0026#x1f44d; thank you so very much for your time \u0026#x231b;. \u0026#x270b; If you are getting any errors, you can create an issue on this repo with proper details.\nIf it is helpful¬†and saves your valuable Time ‚è± please show your support üëá.

When you use the REST API to retrieve posts, the response body will include HTML, including HTML tags. This can be a problem if you are using the REST API to serve data to a non-HTML client, such as a mobile app or a JavaScript library.\nTo remove HTML tags from the REST API title, you can use the following code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 class Customise_WordPress { function __construct($name) { // Remove the REST API HTML tags. $post_type = \u0026#34;post\u0026#34;; add_filter( \u0026#39;rest_prepare_\u0026#39;. $post_type, array( $this, \u0026#39;decode_rest_api_title\u0026#39; ), 20, 3 ); } /** * Decode HTML tags from the website title. * * @param string $response Actual response. * @param Object $request Actual request. * @param Object $post actual Post object. * * @return $response return text with decoded entirties. */ public function decode_rest_api_title( $response, $post, $request ) { if ( isset( $post ) ) { $decoded_title = wp_strip_all_tags( $response-\u0026gt;data[\u0026#39;title\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;rendered\u0026#39;] ); $decoded_content = wp_strip_all_tags( $response-\u0026gt;data[\u0026#39;content\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;rendered\u0026#39;] ); $response-\u0026gt;data[\u0026#39;title\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;rendered\u0026#39;] = $decoded_title; $response-\u0026gt;data[\u0026#39;content\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;rendered\u0026#39;] = $decoded_content; } return $response; } } To use this code, simply copy and paste it into your theme\u0026rsquo;s functions.php file. Then, create a new instance of the Customise_WordPress class. For example:\n1 $customise_wordpress = new Customise_WordPress(); This will remove HTML tags from the REST API title for all posts.\nYou can also modify the code to only remove HTML tags from the REST API title for specific post types. For example, to only remove HTML tags from the REST API title for posts of the post type, you would change the following line:\n1 $post_type = \u0026#34;post\u0026#34;; to:\n1 $post_type = array(\u0026#39;post\u0026#39;); You can also add additional filters to the add_filter() call to remove HTML tags from other fields in the REST API response. For example, to remove HTML tags from the REST API content, you would add the following filter:\n1 add_filter( \u0026#39;rest_prepare_post_content\u0026#39;, array( $this, \u0026#39;decode_rest_api_content\u0026#39; ), 20, 3 ); The decode_rest_api_content() function would be similar to the decode_rest_api_title() function, but it would decode the content field instead of the title field.\nBenefits of removing HTML tags from the REST API title There are several benefits to removing HTML tags from the REST API title:\nIt makes the REST API response more consistent and easier to parse. It reduces the risk of XSS attacks. It improves the performance of the REST API, as HTML tags need to be decoded before they can be used. If you are using the REST API to serve data to a non-HTML client, I recommend that you remove HTML tags from the REST API title and other fields in the REST API response.\nThanks For Reading üôè\nThis articles is generated Manually from generative AI, But carefully reviewed by Me personally.

But what if you want to customize the way a block is rendered? That\u0026rsquo;s where the render_callback argument comes in.\nThe render_callback argument tells WordPress which function to use to render a block. By default, WordPress uses a function called render_block(), which simply renders the block\u0026rsquo;s HTML markup. However, you can override this function to provide your own custom rendering logic.\nTo do this, you can use the register_block_type_args filter. This filter allows you to modify the block type arguments for any block that is registered with WordPress.\nExample for modification The following code snippet shows how to customize the render callback for a block called demo/content-with-sidebar:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 add_filter(\u0026#39;register_block_type_args\u0026#39;, function ($settings, $name) { if ($name == \u0026#39;demo/content-with-sidebar\u0026#39;) { $settings[\u0026#39;render_callback\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;demo_blocks_content_with_sidebar\u0026#39;; } return $settings; }, null, 2); In this example, we are replacing the default render callback function with a function called demo_blocks_content_with_sidebar(). This function could be used to render the block in a custom way, such as wrapping it in a sidebar or adding additional HTML markup.\nTo use this code snippet, simply add it to your theme\u0026rsquo;s functions.php file or to a custom plugin. Once you have done this, WordPress will use the custom render callback function to render the demo/content-with-sidebar block.\ncallback Function Here is an example of a custom render callback function:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 function demo_blocks_content_with_sidebar($attributes, $content) { // Wrap the block content in a sidebar. $sidebar = \u0026#39;\u0026lt;aside\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; $sidebar .= $content; $sidebar .= \u0026#39;\u0026lt;/aside\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; // Return the sidebar markup. return $sidebar; } This function would wrap the block content in a sidebar and return the resulting HTML markup.\nYou can use the register_block_type_args filter to customize the render callback for any block that is registered with WordPress. This can be a useful way to create custom block layouts and effects.\nThanks For Reading üôè\nThis articles is generated Manually from generative AI, But carefully reviewed by Me personally.

This can be useful for projects that use custom PHP coding standards or rulesets.\nWhat is PHPCS? PHPCS is a PHP Coding Standards Fixer. It is a tool that can be used to check PHP code for compliance with a variety of coding standards, such as PSR-1, PSR-2, and PEAR. PHPCS can also be used to fix some coding errors automatically.\nWhat are PHPCS installed paths? PHPCS installed paths are the directories that PHPCS will search for coding standards and rulesets. By default, PHPCS will search the following directories:\nThe src/Standards directory of the PHPCS installation. The Standards directory of the current working directory. How to add the current working directory to the PHPCS installed paths To add the current working directory to the PHPCS installed paths, you can use the following command:\n1 phpcs_ipath=$(phpcs --config-show installed_paths); oldpath=${phpcs_ipath##*:}; phpcs --config-set installed_paths ${oldpath},$(pwd) This command will first get the current PHPCS installed paths using the phpcs --config-show installed_paths command. It will then remove the leading colon from the installed paths using the oldpath=${phpcs_ipath##*:} command. Finally, it will set the PHPCS installed paths to the old installed paths plus the current working directory using the phpcs --config-set installed_paths ${oldpath},$(pwd) command.\nOnce you have run this command, the current working directory will be added to the PHPCS installed paths. This means that PHPCS will be able to find any custom PHP coding standards or rulesets that are located in the current working directory.\nExample usage The following example shows how to use the command to add the current working directory to the PHPCS installed paths:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Get the current PHPCS installed paths. phpcs_ipath=$(phpcs --config-show installed_paths) # Remove the leading colon from the installed paths. oldpath=${phpcs_ipath##*:}; # Set the PHPCS installed paths to the old installed paths plus the current working directory. phpcs --config-set installed_paths ${oldpath},$(pwd) Once you have run this command, the current working directory will be added to the PHPCS installed paths. You can then use PHPCS to check your PHP code for compliance with the custom coding standards or rulesets that are located in the current working directory.\nThanks For Reading üôè\nThis articles is generated Manually from generative AI, But carefully reviewed by Me personally.

For example, to remove HTML entities from the REST API content, you would add the following filter:\n1 add_filter( \u0026#39;rest_prepare_post_content\u0026#39;, array( $this, \u0026#39;decode_rest_api_content\u0026#39; ), 20, 3 ); The decode_rest_api_content() function would be similar to the decode_rest_api_title() function, but it would decode the content field instead of the title field.\nBenefits of removing HTML entities from the REST API title There are several benefits to removing HTML entities from the REST API title:\nIt makes the REST API response more consistent and easier to parse. It reduces the risk of XSS attacks. It improves the performance of the REST API, as HTML entities need to be decoded before they can be used. If you are using the REST API to serve data to a non-HTML client, I recommend that you remove HTML entities from the REST API title and other fields in the REST API response.\nThanks For Reading üôè\nThis articles is generated Manually from generative AI, But carefully reviewed by Me personally.

My wife and Me used to visit Swaminarayan Gurukul Nikol. We get to know that they are having a residential summer camp for 5 days. We approach them that we want to volunteer there.\nAfter Some days they allocated time for us.\nWhat kids learned in summer camp ? There were many activities in the summer camp\nHabit to get up early morning. They do prayer after morning routine. They also got learning from many mentors. And Many more\u0026hellip;. Preparation We started thinking that what we can teach to kids. So they can easily understand. We thought many ideas but we also have to manage with small budget. So we decided to Teach how to make paper camera üì∏ and Goggles ü•Ω.\nGot more hands working with us We did asked about count of students for the summer camp, There was 70 to 80 students in the hall. SO we teach paper camera to all of the volunteers.\nBy doing this volunteers can help us to teach group of students.\nAfter learning All team leaders divided students into a group of specific kids let say 8 to 10 per group. Turns out it was nice idea to teach leaders so they can teach kids easily and our effort reduced very much.\nKids also engaged with leaders to make camera. It was executed as well.\nPlan B For plan B we decided to make goggles if kids complete paper camera early. As we completed on time we do not have to execute this plan B.\nOutcome It went well üòÄ Mostly students complete craft assignments. they also like to make camara from the paper.\nPhoto Gallery Of Summer camp Summer Camp - Shree Swaminarayan Gurukul Nikol Gurukul Thanks For Reading üôè\nIf it is helpful¬†and saves your valuable Time ‚è± please show your support üëá.

Fill the details for the website and renew the date accordingly.\nHow to Test Properly First Test the main function by running in the editor. It will show unverified because you have not verified this app on google cloud, No problem you will need to click on Advance. Then click the unsafe option. No Problem you can verify your script later.\nThis will not remind automatically, We need to set up a trigger for the function.\nYou can add and customise this code according to your needs and requirements.\nFeel free to drop a comment if you need more tutorials like this.\nCreativity ü™î You can create anything for reminder or notification. You can add multiple services like Email. You can use Zapier type services as well. You can send your server to pause the user. HestiaCP and other Hosting panels provides API so we can use it on Google Sheets as well. This list is very long and it is free to use.

Order split is in terms of the Multi vendor woocommerce website that have below plugin installed.\nProduct Vendor Plugin\nWoo Order Splitter\nLet me give the idea Woo order splitter. The Product vendor plugin is creates multi vendor marketplace that have multiple vendors like amazon we have multiple sellers that sell their limited Product.\nBut amazon has multiple products like TV, Fridge , mobile, Mitti Pot, Footwear and lots of variety. Because all sellers can not have all things ya there are some exceptions Like Cloudtail and all.but small sellers have limited items to sell.\nSo if anybody wants to make a website like amazon multi seller feature then this website is the right place for you.\nWorking of Woocommerce order splitter Let\u0026rsquo;s Now understand the What the Order splitter is doing.It is very interesting to see here. We can split order on any term, which means if we want to split order by order vendor again taking the example of Amazon ( not sponsored \u0026#x1f605; ).\nIf we order one Grocery item and one electronic item like a Bag of Rice and Apple Iphone then there is a sure probability that our order has multiple sellers. So by default woocommerce does not assign vendors and split the order on the Product based vendor but this plugin does.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume we have a woocommerce site and have thousands of products and hundreds of vendors then it will be very hard and time consuming to assign and maintain orders and deliveries with communication with different sellers.\nThe Problem We can use this plugin in this scenario, this plugin is easily splitting order, in The depth this plugin finds the vendor of each product, then makes the list of products in the order for particular seller. After that it creates a new order and assigns the vendor to specific order then the vendor can see on their dashboard and Fulfillment of the Order process starts.\nNow you will be wondering what happens to my original order ? yes that order is definitely going to trash and the user profile will show the Two order if my original order id is 3366 then 3366 order will be deleted and new order created with the order id 3367 and 3368. And both will assign to their sellers.\nThe solution We can add below code if user Order not split but want to assign order vendor to the user order.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 \u0026lt;?php /** * Customization for Order meta * */ add_action(\u0026#39;woocommerce_thankyou\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;add_custom_order_meta\u0026#39;, 10, 1); functionadd_custom_order_meta( $order_id ) { $order = wc_get_order($order_id); /** * if Order splitter works the order will be trash and empty array will return. * so we are checking the order content. */ if( ! empty( $order ) ){ $items = $order-\u0026gt;get_items(); foreach( $items as $key=\u0026gt; $item ){ $product_id = $item-\u0026gt;get_product_id(); $vendor = get_the_terms( $product_id, \u0026#39;wcpv_product_vendors\u0026#39; ); $vendor_id = $vendor[0]-\u0026gt;term_id; update_post_meta($order_id, \u0026#39;_vendor_id\u0026#39;, $vendor_id); $vendor_data = get_term_meta($vendor_id, \u0026#39;vendor_data\u0026#39;); $vendor_info = array( \u0026#39;vendor_email\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $vendor_data[0][\u0026#39;email\u0026#39;], \u0026#39;vendor_name\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $vendor[0]-\u0026gt;name, \u0026#39;vendor_slug\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $vendor[0]-\u0026gt;slug, ); update_post_meta($order_id, \u0026#39;wos_vendor_data\u0026#39;, $vendor_info); break; // For test uncomment this and place order one in view source. // print_r( get_post_meta($order_id, \u0026#39;wos_vendor_data\u0026#39;, true) ); // die(); } } } If it is helpful¬†and saves your valuable Time ‚è± please show your support üëá.
